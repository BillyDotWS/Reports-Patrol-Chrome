A chrome addon for Report Patrol on the Mineplex Network (https://mineplex.com/reporstpatrol) that makes life easier for Moderators. This chrome addon adds extra quality of life tools to the Moderator view of handling forum reports, it has multiple features to make logging & responding to reports faster and reduce fuss. This is an open-source addon and is not owned by Mineplex, it will remain up, even after I resign from Mineplex (although, as mentioned within the liscence, I am not responsible for maintaining this software).
